Added the basic stuff of fetching the corresponding elements from the message

(From,To,Subject,CC, Message) .. Very Naive method. Need to improve it.

Copied the original code from email_parsing.py to this code

Changed the code so as to generate the unique mails faster.

Also changed the code so that stopwords are removed faster.

Need to add the matrix creation to this 

Also need to once modify the text parsing here.. to take into consideration the special symbols and character.

Need some polishing on the text and the emailids.
Need to check the results once.
